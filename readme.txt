05/20/2018: Test of the Adafruit HUZZAH ESP8266 wifi module is complete.
I can now connect to the led_zepplin wifi network and make a connection with 
a site on the internet. Right now the installed code is 
AdvancedWebServer_led_zepplin. A test page is displayed at the module's IP address.

Next Steps: Connect the MPL3115A2 sensor to the ESP8266 breakout board via I2C
and print the values to the webpage. The end game is to send the data to a 
webpage that is publically available over the Internet.
